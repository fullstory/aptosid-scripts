.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
.BR fw\-detect
fw\-detect scans the loaded modules on your system, checks if they require
firmware and checks if the firmware is present in the correct location.

By default it will only output information about any modules which appear to
require firmware.  With the \-a option you can see the information for all
modules fw-detect knows about.   With the \-y option it will attempt to install
any missing firmwares where possible.   With the \-i option it will only attempt
to install missing firmware for the given module, though it will still provide
the information about other modules which it believes require firmware.
